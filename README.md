# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-reviews-with-Machine-Learning
* In this project, I built classical Machine Learning models that trains on data about IMDB reviews which are classified as positive or negative.
* Then I compared the models performance to find the best one.
* I then exported that model using pickle.
* Finally, I made a simple UI with streamlit to provide an interface to allow users to input new data and classify them.

The models I created are: MultinominalNB, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier
